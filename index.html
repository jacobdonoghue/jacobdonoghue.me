              Learning music is hard&#x2014;and learning music online is even harder.
              Out of subjects that transfer to an online setting naturally, music is at the very bottom of the list. 
              In summer of 2020, 5 other Dartmouth Students and I decided to try to fill this gap by creating a music education web-app for our final project in a web development class. 
              After building together a prototype in 3 weeks, we decided to bring Warbler to the world. 
              Since September 2020, the rest of the Warbler team and I have been developing a new version of Warbler that features:
              <ul>
                <li>Interactive lessons with sightreading, rhythm-matching, listening, and sight-singing exercises to learn foundational musicianship skills</li>
                <li>Assessment tools and personalized feedback</li>
                <li>Easy lesson-creation tools for teachers</li>
                <li>A fun and game-like interface</li>
              </ul> 
              
              We just launched the beta-version of Warbler, will undergo thorough beta-testing all summer, and plan to bring Warbler into classrooms starting in September 2021.

              Understanding the spread and containment of infectious diseases is more important than ever. 
              While quarantining at home in spring of 2020, I created a SIR model of infectious disease spread in Java specifically geared toward modeling how different containment measures, such as wearing masks and social distancing, affect the spread of the disease. 
              Specifically, I wanted to assess the effectiveness of social distancing given varying levels of:
              <ul>
                <li>Participation -- What proportion of the population engages in social distancing? </li>
                <li>Intensity -- How much do social distancing measures affect a healthy person's likelihood of infection when in close quarters with someone infected with the virus.</li>
                <li>Response time -- At what level of infection (as a percent of the population) are social distancing measures engaged?</li>
                <li>Re-opening -- When are social distancing measures are lifted?</li>
              </ul>
              Because the simulation relies on random number generation, results were obtained by running the simulation numerous times under each set of parameters and then averaged before analyzing results.
              Before introducing the main conclusions, I must note that the simulation offered a vastly simplified version of disease spread, and its results are not necessarily applicable to more complex systems. 
              With that said, its results shed light as how variation in the aspects of social distancing noted above would likely affect infection levels in a more complex environment.
              In analyzing the results, I found that, unsurprisingly:
              <ul>
                <li>Social distancing precautions work to decrease infection levels</li>
                <li>Given the exponential nature of disease growth, the earlier and more intense the precautions are, the more effective they will be in stemming the disease.</li>
                <li>Ending social distancing early leads to a resurgence in infection</li>
              </ul>
              Interestingly: 
              <ul>
                <li>Participation in uniform social distancing measures appeared to have a greater effect on disease spread than intensity of these measures</li>
                <li>Baseline adoption of precautions is only marginally helpful: each additional precaution taken offers increasingly greater potential to decrease the scope of infection.</li>
              </ul>
              For anyone interested in reading more about the structure, methodology, and results of the study, I attached my paper and code below.

              In summer 2020, a group of other Dartmouth students and I teamed up to create a sudoku game that could both solve and generate unique sudoku puzzles.
              We used a backtracking (depth-first-search) algorithm to solve any given puzzle, systematically checking every possibiltiy until a solution is found.
              To generate puzzles, our algorithm generates a grid filled with random entries and adds numbers until there is only one solution. 
              While using backtracking algorithms are guaranteed to succeed, it can have an extremely slow runtime for problem puzzles -- O(9^(n*n)) where n is the number of boxes per side -- so much of the challenge lay in optimizing our backtracking to be more intelligent in selecting the next number to add.
              Within my group, I took an organizational leadership role while also coding the backtracking and generation algorithms and creating the GUI in python.

              This summer, I created a search-engine in C that searches the website for Dartmouth's CS50 course.
              The algorithm is composed of three parts:
              <ul>
                <li>Crawler <span><i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></span> crawls every page up to a given degree of removal from the seed page, and stores their URL and HTML source code in a local server</li>
                <li>Indexer <span><i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></span> goes through every page found by the crawler, parses the HTML, counts the frequency of every word in every document, and write the 'index' into a file</li>
                <li>Querier <span><i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i></span> reads in search input from the commandline, searches the index for the user-inputted terms, and ranks all documents by the frequency of search terms </li>
