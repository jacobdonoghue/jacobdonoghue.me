                        Since it'll be a little harder to get to know you online, here's a little bio. I'm a '22 from DC (currently quarantining in the other Washington). Academically, I'm planning on double-majoring in CS and Government. Extracurricularly, I'm a member of the Dartmouth Aires (hence the getup in the second photo) and I also enjoy running and making music on my own. One fun fact is that I this winter term teaching high school english and music-directing a musical at a community theatre in Majuro, Marshall Islands with YouthBridge Global.
                        It probably took me longer than it should've to figure this out and at times got me feeling like the first photo, but I'm excited to keep learning!
