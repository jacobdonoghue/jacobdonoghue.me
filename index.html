            Website of Jacob Donoghue for CS52. Since it'll be a little harder to get to know you online, here's a little bio. I'm a '22 from DC (currently quarantining in the other Washington) and I'm planning on double-majoring in CS and Government. It probably took me longer than it should've to figure this out, but I'm excited for the rest of the class!
